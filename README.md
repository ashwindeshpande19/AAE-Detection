# AAE-Detection

Investigating Bias in Hate Speech Detection
This project investigates potential biases in hate speech detection systems towards African American English (AAE) and develops methods to mitigate such biases.

The main components of the project are:

Training classification models on Twitter datasets to categorize text as hate speech, offensive language, or neutral
Building an AAE detection model to identify text originating from African American users
Using word embeddings to replace potentially offensive terms with less inflammatory synonyms
Analyzing if debiasing techniques reduce misclassification of AAE text as hate speech
